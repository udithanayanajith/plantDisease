Cactus,Cactus rot,1,high vulnerability during early stages 1 month to 6 months,"there2 types of rots, root rots caused by overwatering and stem rots caused due to bacteria and fungi.
","stem rots symptoms are dark liquid oozing from the cacti stem, swelling stems, mushy stems and stem bruising.","to cure cacti stem rot remove the affected part of the plant immediately and treat it with a fungicide (chemical to destroy fungi) or hydrogen peroxide.
",keep the soil around plants moist not wet. Ensure good ventilation in any confined places where the cacti plant may be.
Cactus,Yellowing of Cactus,3,1-4 years old,"over-watering, insufficient sunlight, incorrect soil, too much fertilizer (Especially nitrogen) and also allowing dust to build up on plant","yellow or white spots on a cactus plant caused by over-fertilizing
Shrivelled-up leaves due to little water and too much sun exposure.
","give the roots plenty of room to breathe. Ensure that cacti receive sufficient sunlight and ventilation. Feed the plant with a cactus fertilizer.
",
Cactus,Sunburnt cactus,3,"first 3 years
",cacti exposure to direct sunlight,"loss of green colour, brown spots in cactus skin and withered leaves.","move the cactus to a location with more shade and mist the plant frequently to keep the plant hydrated. Use water rich in nutrients and cactus fertilizer on the soil surrounding the roots of the affected plant.
",
Cactus,Frost damaged cactus,3,upto 2 two years old,"exposure to freezing conditions or extreme temperature, ",white colouration of leaves. Dry spots appear on the body of the plant. Brown or yellow spots and patches,"overwater plants during winter months to prevent any potential freezing conditions. Move the plant to a location with warmer temperatures and give them more sunlight so it will help to speed up the process of healing the plant.
",
Cactus,Fusariosis,4,3 to 8 years,"the fungus causing this is ” fusarium oxyporum”. The fungus enters the roots initially through tiny wounds that are more likely caused by nematodes. Then the fungus spread upward throughout the cacti.
","pink or white mold appears around the base of the plant. The entire cactus starts to wilt and become discolored, turning red or purple. A bad rotting smell is given off by the plant.
","cut out infected areas with a sharp knife and dust the wounds with charcoal or Sulphur dust. As fusarium spreads fast in hot, wet conditions keep the plant as dry as possible. 
",To reduce the risk of introducing fusarium to its environment always sterilize pots and use new sterile soil to plant a cactus.
Cactus,Neck rot,4,2 to 5 years old,"neck rot is caused by a fungus called “phytophthora”.  This fungus generally appears due to excessive watering.
","black or brown discoloration at the base of the stems.
","all the rotted parts of the plant must be pruned off. If it is not completely removed it will spread quickly once again killing the cactus.
",avoid excessive watering and flooding of soil where cactus is planted.
Cactus,Phyllosticta pad spot,5,5 to 10 years,"generally caused by a fungus called “phyllosticta”. This disease is found most commonly throughout the desert. Pads on the lower part of plants are often most heavily infected since the humidity is higher and moisture often persists after watering. 
","black lesions on the surface of the infected plant tissue.
",remove infected parts of the plant.,
Anthuriums,Bacterial blight,1,during the first year,caused by bacteria that infect the anthurium plant by entering pores along the leaf margins. The bacteria also enter if leaf tissues become torn through pruning or even if leaf tissues are punctured by insects. Warm temperatures and high humidity contribute to this.,yellowed-leaved and water-soaked lesions along the leaf margins that grow rapidly to form dead V-shaped lesions.  Leaves show a bronzed appearance and floral quality is reduced and plants wilt and die.,lower greenhouse humidity and temperature b increasing air circulation.  Discard affected parts of the plant. Use fungicides,"Sterilize knives and clippers by dipping cutting tools in disinfectant between harvesting different plants

"
Anthuriums,Bacterial wilt,1,2 months to 2 years,"spreads rapidly throughout the vascular system of plants. The bacteria causing this is “Ralstonia solanacearum” which colonizes soil for years. 
","leaf yellowing. Turn veins in leaves and stems a brown, bronze color. Bacterial ooze from cuts in the stem of highly infected plants.
","use pesticides containing copper, mancozeb and phosphorus. Increase air circulation to leaves. ",Ensure that the pruning shears are sterilized and sanitized before using.
Anthuriums,Rhizoctonia root rot,2,"1 month to 9 months
","caused by “Rhizoctonia fungus”. The fungus attacks the roots and the lower parts of the stem that are in closest contact with the soil.
","dark mushy roots, rotten smell, visible fungus growth, discoloration, wilting and drooping leaves.
",repot the plant in freshly prepared soil in a new sterilized pot. Throw away the old soil.,
Anthuriums,Oomycetes rot,4,2-4 years,"caused by Phytophthora or Pythium fungi. These fungi attack the root system to trigger root rot in anthuriums.
","dark mushy roots, rotten smell, discoloration, wilting and drooping leaves. Under severe conditions, the foliage may show black to brown leaf lesions.
","Use well-drainer, synthetic soil mixes. repot the plant in freshly prepared soil in a new sterilized pot. Throw away the old soil.
",
Anthuriums,Black nose disease,3,6 months to 2 years,"caused by a fungus called “Colletotrichum gloeosporioides”. In anthurium this fungus only attacks the spadix of the flower.
Symptoms: dark ring around spadix initially and thereafter entire spadix turns to dark brown colour.
",use fungicide containing mancozeb.,,
Orchids,Black rot,3,1 to 5 years,caused by fungi called pythium ultimum and phytophthora cactorum and this affects a wide variety of orchids. Infections start on the roots and spread rapidly in high temperatures and high humidities.,"dark blackish spots or lesions on affected parts. Affected leaves may turn yellow. The lesions will be soft and exude water when pressure is applied.
"," isolated infected plants from other plants and remove the infected tissue with sterile tools and drench them with a suitable fungicide. Cinnamon could also be used as a very effective fungicide.
",
Orchids,Southern blight/ collar rot,4,2 to 6 years,this is caused by a fungus called “Sclerotium rolfsii” that lives in soil. This fungus thrives at high temperatures and humidity,"the rapid collapse and rotting of roots, pseudobulbs and lower parts of leaves. They turn creamy yellow. Small yellow or tan sclerotia resembling mustard seeds form on the affected tissue.
","remove the infected part of roots and leaves using sterile cutting tools and drench the remaining plant in a suitable fungicide. Disinfect the growing area with a 10% bleach solution.
","normal sanitation, good air movement and lower temperatures may help reduce the spread of this disease.
"
Orchids,Fusarium wilt,5,10 to 30 years,"caused by a fungus. It blocks the flow of moisture through a plant’s vascular system. Infects a plant through orchid roots or by invading the rhizome of recently divided plants.  Often spread through improper hygiene.
","infected leaves are yellow, thin, shrivelled, wrinkled or wilted. If the disease is extensive, the entire rhizome may turn purple and will eventually extend to pseudobulbs.
","re-pot only the part of the plant showing no purple discolouration. Drench-sanitized plants in a suitable fungicide.
","Ensure that the pruning shears are sterilized and sanitized before use.
"
Orchids,Brown rot/ fungal root rot,4,2 to 15 years,"occur when the medium breaks down, drainage is poor and plants are overwatered. Rot sets in when the roots are damaged by injury or salt buildup from hard water or overfertilizing. 
","pseudobulbs turn brown from bottom to up and hard and ultimately become husky. Leaves become yellow and shrivel up. 
","remove infected parts of the plant using sterile cutting tools and drench the remaining plant in suitable fungicide. Disinfect the growing area with a 10% bleach solution.
","Make sure your potting media is fresh and your plants are not overwatered. In hard-water areas, pots should be flushed at least monthly to prevent root damage by watering heavily to solubilize the salts and then watering heavily an hour later to flush the salts from the pot.
"
Orchids,Anthracnose wilt,5,10 to 20 years old,caused by a fungus in the genus “Colletotrichum”. This fungal disease infects the aerial portion of the plant. The leaves are most often attacked.,"Leaf tips turn brown beginning at the apex and proceeding toward the base. Dark brown or light grey patches develop, sometimes as concentric rings or as numerous dark bands across the leaf. Sporing bodies develop in the infected area. Flowers develop watery, black or brown pustules which are usually raised and occur on the underside of older sepals and petals
",Spray with a suitable fungicide containing copper.,"Normal sanitation, good air movement, lower temperatures (if possible) and increased light may help reduce the spread of this disease.  The pathogen is most active in warm weather when light is low and moisture is high. "
Orchids,Botrytis petal blight,2,6 months to 20 years,"Botrytis is caused by a fungus that thrives when the weather is cool and damp. This particular fungus attacks the blooms
","Very small, black or light brown, spots on the flowers. The spots may enlarge and cover the entire flower. If conditions are moist, a grey fungal growth may appear on severely infected or decaying flowers. 
","Remove infected flowers, then spray with a suitable fungicide like Daconil. Some report success with the home remedy of baking soda, 1/2 tsp dissolved in 1 quart of water sprayed on the flowers. Always follow label instructions. This fungus is common in the environment and cannot be eradicated. 
","Remove infected flowers since these are reservoirs of infection. Infection may be reduced through careful sanitation, increased air circulation, reduced humidity and warmer night temperatures (>68F).
